there are actually these global variable to control song

    song_array // the information of what to play
    play_sound // to control whether we want to play sound or not from outside funcion
    taiko_on // to know wheter to show the taiko pattern or not
the sound playing + song info display will be wrap up in a function and in a thread


there is another thread with higher priority, when we want to pause a song
we push a swich->causing an interrupt -> change "play_sound" to false
-> add an function into the eventqueue of thread 

this function will have an infinite loop, it will keep detecting whether we scroll, 
push the switch, if we go into the song selection mode, we will enter an sub-infinite loop.
The song selection is actually modify the global variable :song_array".
After finishing all the task, we will just return();


There is only one song in the Taiko game mode, in this mode
we will enable the taiko_on, so there will be taiko pattern

the taiko pattern will change per second, if in a second, we hit 
then will add one point
